Noise and Signal

<p>Focus can mean a lot of things for people and it could mean anything from concentrating on doing homework or reducing noise in the environment.</p>
<p>For me focus means to seek personal value by changing extrinsict motivations to intrinsict motivations. </p>
<p>In a school like Waterloo where life centers around extrinsic motivators such as grades and co-op jobs, it is very easy to get "distracted".</p>
<p>Distracted not in the sense of partying or games, but rather in the sense that personal value is sought through comparisons with individuals around you.</p>
<p>There is no school like Waterloo where you can hear rumors about someone's "big 4" co-op job or how "Cali or bust" is actually a motto.</p>
<p>Such examples are not just jokes, but manifestations of the mentality students here often put themselves into.</p>
<p>Such mentality is like treading on thin ice since your existence depends on external motivators and I have seen classmates feel the un-necessary pressure.</p>
<p>Especially in a school like Waterloo where there are so many outstanding individuals it is easy to lose sight of yourself, and I know this from experience.</p>
<p>That is why I advocate for people to focus on themselves, take a day off, turn off your laptop, delete linkedin off your phone - "focus" on yourself.</p>
<p>Take the opportunity to do what you enjoy because there is so much more to enjoy in life than this place called "University".</p>
<p>For those struggling to focus on themselves, I applaud you for your effort and I want you to know that you are not the only one going thorugh the struggle.</p>
<p>There is no other school than Waterloo that makes students juggle academics and coop with intensity, and that alone deserves praise.</p>

<p>At the end of the day you are what matters most in life.</p>
<p>It's your time to shine.</p>
