<h1>**Hello World**</h1>
The year might be coming to an end but my journey is just about to dawn. 
My name is Seiji, and I am a self-proclaimed enthusiast of Computer Science and Economics.  As of today I am currently on a gap year, and I hope to record my journey to find my place throughout this ever changing world.
