<h1>Reflecting on 1A</h1>
<p>I've finally finished my exams at my first term in Waterloo and wanted to reflect on my term here.</p>

<p>I want to start off by thanking my professors for spending the time teaching in-class and outside of class, I would have not survived the semester without the sincere help from my professors.</p>
<p>Reflecting back I am quite disappointed with myself and how the semester went.</p>
<p>I expected to come to Waterloo and figure everything about my life - that everything will come together. </p>
<p>Now that I have finished my semester I feel more lost than ever. Perhaps I was naive mistaking the correlation with causation.</p>
<p>Although I've focused on what I didn't get, I want to share what I gained from the semester.</p>
<p>I learned the warmth of kindness from my friends I was able to make here at Waterloo. As a foreigner living in Canada for the first time </p>
<p>I also learned of the wonderful culture and diverse people of Canada.</p>
<p>There was much to gain and learn from this semester and needless to say I am looking forward to my next semester at Waterloo</p>


<p>Note to future self: You will fall forward.</p>
